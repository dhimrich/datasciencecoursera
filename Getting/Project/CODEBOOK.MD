This document is based on the file "feaures_info.txt" included in the zip file from which the UCI HAR data sets were extracted. The original inertial signal data stored on the smartphones were ignored for this project. The project requirements were that the mean and standard deviation variables should be summarized by calculating their means. Those variables were:

 [1] "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"               "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"              
 [3] "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"               "tBodyAcc-std()-X"

The output data set columns 3 through 81 contain the mean values of these measurements for each combination of Activity and Subject. The variable names in columns 3 through 81 are those listed above, prepended with the string "avg.".

There are 6 Activities, identified in Column 1 by the labels:
 "WALKING"            "WALKING\_UPSTAIRS"   "WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS"
 "SITTING"            "STANDING"           "LAYING"            

The variable name for column 1 is "Activity2".

Column 2 contains integers 1 through 30 designating the 30 Subjects of the study, each of whom performed 6 different Activities while wearing a smartphone. The variable name is "Subject". Together, the variables in columns 1 and 2 identify 180 groups of measurements. The means of the 79 variables listed above within each of those 180 groups appear together on each row in the data set.
